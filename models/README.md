# Models directory üß†

This directory is intended for storing the pre-trained model files used in the document vector representation project. Due to the large size and binary nature of these models, it is not recommended to upload them directly to GitHub.

## Usage ‚úè
1. Download the necessary model files from their respective sources:
   - For English: [Google's word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)
   - For Spanish: [Spanish Billion Words Corpus and Embeddings (SBWCE)](https://crscardellino.github.io/SBWCE/)
2. Place the downloaded model files into this directory.

**Note**: Storing large binary files in Git repositories can significantly increase the size of your repository and may lead to difficulties in cloning and fetching. For these reasons, we avoid uploading these models directly to GitHub.
